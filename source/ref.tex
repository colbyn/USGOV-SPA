I mentioned the article denoted by \textbf{`\textsuperscript{†}'} very frequently, this was a document with a few essays therein from both proponents and opponents. The bottom of each essay noted several names backing the essay in question, but I couldn't find the names of the main authors themselves. I hope this won't cause issues. Also regarding the word count, this is based on the words from sections 1 to 5 (i.e. everything from References and Miscellaneous isn't counted). Specially, given that this essay is open source, the counted words are those from the `source/body.tex' file.
